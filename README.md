# The Yellow Runner

**The Yellow Runner** is an immersive and engaging game where players control a small square with a mission to color as much of the game map as possible. As you navigate through a variety of levels, you'll encounter different enemies and obstacles, creating an exciting and challenging experience.

## Game Overview

In **The Yellow Runner**, you will embark on a journey across **100 unique levels**, each with distinct map layouts and configurations. Your primary objective is to color the cells on the grid, aiming to complete the entire map or achieve over **80% coverage** on larger maps to progress to the next level.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Continuous Movement**: 
  - The player controls the square using the **arrow keys**, similar to the classic movement style seen in *Pac-Man*. The square moves forward constantly in the direction it is facing.
  - Direction can be changed using the arrow keys. If there is an obstacle (like a wall) in the new direction, the square will continue in its previous direction until it can change.

- **Game Map Interaction**: 
  - Each cell on the grid can change color based on player interaction.
  - Cells that have been traversed by the player will turn **yellow**, indicating they have been visited, while cells that block movement will be colored **black**.

- **Enemy Encounters**:
  - Players will face various enemies that add to the challenge:
    - **Red Enemies**: These enemies chase the player directly, making them a significant threat.
    - **Blue Enemies**: Move diagonally, adding complexity to the navigation strategy.
    - **Purple Enemies**: Move strictly horizontally or vertically, depending on their path.
    - **Brown Enemies**: Exhibit random movement in any direction, making their patterns unpredictable.
    - **Magenta Enemies**: Multiple magenta enemies communicate and send rays between themselves at timed intervals, requiring players to stay alert.

### Level Progression and Challenges

- Players must achieve specific objectives to complete each level:
  - Color the entire map or exceed **80% coverage** to advance to the next level.
  - Each new level introduces more complex map structures and a greater number of enemies, increasing the difficulty and requiring enhanced strategic thinking.

### Timer System and Game Events

- The game incorporates a timer system that regulates movement and interactions between the player and enemies, ensuring smooth gameplay and real-time reactions.
- Important events such as "Game Over" and "Level Completed" are indicated through message boxes, prompting players to either restart or move on to the next challenge.

### Counting Colored Cells

- The game keeps track of how many cells have been colored. 
- Cells are checked for color status to determine if they are blocked (black) or have been colored by the player (yellow), providing feedback on progress.

### Installation and Requirements

To play **The Yellow Runner**, you will need:
- Microsoft Excel with macro support enabled.
- Basic knowledge of navigating Excel spreadsheets.

### How to Play

1. **Clone the repository** and open the Excel file.
2. **Enable macros** when prompted.
3. Use the **arrow keys** to control your square's movement.
4. Avoid the enemies while coloring the cells to successfully complete each level.

### Future Development Plans

As we continue to develop **Color Chaser**, we plan to introduce:
- **Additional Levels**: New maps with unique challenges and layouts.
- **New Enemies**: Introduce a variety of new enemy types, each with unique behaviors and mechanics to enhance gameplay complexity.
- **Power-Ups and Bonuses**: Incorporate various power-ups that provide temporary advantages to the player.
- **Enhanced Graphics and Sound**: Improve visual elements and audio feedback for a more immersive experience.
- **Leaderboard and Scoring System**: Track player scores and level completions for competitive gameplay.

## Conclusion

**The Yellow Runner** offers a captivating blend of strategic navigation, quick reflexes, and problem-solving challenges, making it an enjoyable experience for players of all ages. We invite you to contribute to the project, share your feedback, and help us enhance the gameplay experience as we continue to grow the game!
